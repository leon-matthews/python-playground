# Generate and solve Sodoku puzzles

For a time, my daughter was very enthusiastic about Sodoku puzzles. This
package is my attempt to solve and generate increasingly difficult puzzles with
reference to the way humans solve them - not just another backtracking solver.

Her enthusiasm has since waned, so I'm not sure this project will continue (if
I ever want to solve some difficult puzzles I just go to my day job!). That
said, I'll leave it here for a year or two to see if anybody else wants to
pick it up.
